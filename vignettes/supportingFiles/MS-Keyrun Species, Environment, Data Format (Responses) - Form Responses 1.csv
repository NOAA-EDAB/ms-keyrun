Timestamp,Email Address,Which species should be included in the multispecies models?,Rationale for species included,What environmental data are needed?,Rationale for environmental time series included,Is your model implemented in or run from R?,Can your model use data from an R data package?,Should we maintain datasets as an R data package for this project?,Any other thoughts?

Pulling in data from an R package will just be an additional step that will need to be integrated into the workflow. For example, currently the data required to run Hydra exists in an Rdata file that is bundled with an R package (hydradata). The user will just need to replace subsets of the bundled data the the data we add to this new data package."
