Timestamp,Email Address,What year should keyrun time series *start*?,Rationale for start time,What year should keyrun time series *end*?,Rationale for end time,"What seasonal resolution is needed (surveys)? NEFSC bottom trawl survey at minimum, may add others",Rationale for survey temporal resolution,What seasonal resolution is needed (fisheries)? ,Rationale for fishery temporal resolution,What is the spatial definition of Georges Bank?,Rationale for spatial definition,Any other thoughts? Thanks!
6/17/2020 10:04:16,kiersten.curti@noaa.gov,1/1/1978,Due to the availability of age data (if I am recalling correctly),12/31/2019,As recent as possible to maximize relevance.  ,Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter (for all surveys) as defined by NEFSC survey,"because several of the species exhibit strong seasonal migrations.  While the MS-SCAA model has an annual time step, the equations can account for the additional mortality from Jan-1 to the timing of the survey.",Annual (all fisheries),Annual catches are inputted into the ms-scaa model.,"Define as Fishery areas (521-522, 525-526, 551-552, 561-562), try to map survey data to these areas https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/greater-atlantic-region-statistical-areas","The spatial information associated with the trawl survey data is MUCH better than that associated with the fishery data (i.e. VTR) and for many trips area information is completely missing, so I would advise against trying to parse the fishery data to a finer resolution than NAFO stat areas.  ","Now that we have ~10 years of Bigelow data, many (most?) assessments split the time series into two separate survey time series in the assessment models"
6/17/2020 10:41:49,andrew.beet@noaa.gov,1/1/1964,Current starting time for hydra. However bottom temp data not available until 1976. ,12/31/2019,We should use as much data as possible so the most recent year that has complete data. Hydra currently uses data up to 2016,Annual (all surveys): combine all available survey seasons,current aggregation level of Hydra,Annual (all fisheries),Same as for survey,"Define as Fishery areas (521-522, 525-526, 551-552, 561-562), try to map survey data to these areas https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/map/greater-atlantic-region-statistical-areas",# 2 is ideal choice but i don't believe it is possible  (with sufficient confidence) to aggregate all data into this footprint. Hydra fisheries effort data is aggregated to #4,My responses are based on Hydra. I am not considering other models in my responses. The exception to this is the question relating to spatial footprint. Thanks Sarah
6/19/2020 10:41:06,Sean.Lucey@NOAA.gov,1/1/1967,"1967 is the first year with both a fall and spring bottom trawl survey.  Commercial catch records should also be available for this time period.  While the GB Rpath model is parameterized for 2013-2015, we will probably want to conduct some sort of hindcast.  We will have to experiment with various time frames to figure out which works best.",12/31/2019,This is the last full year of data available for Georges Bank.  We want to run the model as close to contemporary times as possible.,Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter (for all surveys) as defined by NEFSC survey,"Currently the GB RPath model is parameterized using the fall bottom trawl survey.  However, we may try and fit a seasonal pattern to the biomass pools.",Monthly (all fisheries),Rpath has a monthly time step.  If we are able to generate a seasonal pattern of biomass it would make the most sense to attempt to force fishing that way as well.,"Define as Ecosystem Production Unit (Fig 16.1 here: https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/epu.html), try to subset fishery data to this footprint",The GB Rpath model is based of the EPU and designed to be used for that spatial footprint.  Will need to discuss further the best ways to associate commercial landings to that footprint.,My responses are trying to think as broad as possible.  It may not be necessary for all of the data requested but at least we will be working from a common data set no matter what the time frame ends up being.
6/30/2020 9:19:35,robert.gamble@noaa.gov,1/1/1967,Earliest survey data we have for both spring and fall,12/31/2019,Use the latest full year of data available,Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter (for all surveys) as defined by NEFSC survey,"While there are questions that can only be answered at a smaller spatial scale, the surveys are limited to seasonal.  Individual data streams could be brought in at a finer resolution if needed.",Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter (for all fisheries) as defined by NEFSC survey,To match the survey scale.,"Define as Ecosystem Production Unit (Fig 16.1 here: https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/epu.html), try to subset fishery data to this footprint",If we feel that the EPUs are a valid construct and that future work (and SOEs) will use them then it makes sense to utilize them here as well.,
