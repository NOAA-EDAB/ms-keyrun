They will be needed for the estimation part. However they would be useful - prior to estimation- to help calibrate the simulation model.,"Species diet composition: % of each other modeled species observed in diet, Predator size specific diet composition: % of each other modeled species in diet by predator size class, Prey size specific diet composition: % by size class of prey (each other modeled species) in diet, Predator and prey size specific diet composition: % by size class of prey in diet by predator size class, Predator mean stomach weight (total over all prey), Predator gastric evacuation rate",Most of this info would be synthesized outsize of the model (maybe with some intermediate analyses) with the results used in the model. Would also be needed for documentation to explain how we arrive at values used in the model,All of this data will inform us of the community structure/ foodweb. We should try to keep the same set of feeding relationships/ links across models. All steps from obtaining this data to its use in the models should be documented. ps. i think i checked everything!
